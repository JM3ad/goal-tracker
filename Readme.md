# Goal Tracker App

A simple project for tracking goals across time.

## Zero To Hero

* Set up the project with `npm install`
* Run `npm run build` and `npm run build:css` to compile the assets
* Run it locally with `npm run start`
  * Combine this with `npm run build:css-dev` if you intend to make changes to the CSS
* Run the tests with `npm run test`
* The app is automatically deployed on every push to main
* A pre-commit hook exists to automatically run formatting, but it can also be ran with `npm run format`

## To Do

* Set up proper linting
