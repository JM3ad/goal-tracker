# Scratch React

An experimental project for exploring setting up a React App without using create-react-app.

## Zero To Hero

- Set up the project with `npm install`
- Run it locally with `npm run start`
- The app is automatically deployed on every push
- A pre-commit hook exists to automatically run formatting, but it can also be ran with `npm run format`

## To Do

- Set up tests
- Set up proper linting
- Set up sensible deployment policy (e.g. `main` only)
